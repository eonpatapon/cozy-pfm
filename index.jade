                I have a lot of respect for Mark and I'm addicted to Facebook,
                but his business is to sell my data. So my answer is no.

                I don't know about you, but I have always felt uncomfortable to
                give my data to Mint-like services. Especially thinking that
                some day these services will
                probably be acquired by Google/Facebook/Amazon/Whatever 
                freaks me out.

                I'm a freelancer and I spend too much money in my servers. I
                needed a tool to fetch my operations from my bank accounts and
                to provide me services on top of this data. A trustworthy
                finance manager was definitely missing.

                A trustworthy web finance manager was missing.
            p
                | When 
                a(href="http://cozy.io/")Cozy, a startup that develops an open
                | source personal
                | cloud, hired me the first time, it was to prototype a
                | webmail client. I enjoyed working with them so
                | when they contacted me to build a trustworthy money manager,
                | I immediately started to work on it. The tough part came from
                | the fact that banks don't provide any APIs to access to my
                | data. Fortunately, I discovered an
                | awesome FOSS project called 
                a(href="http://weboob.org") Weboob 
                | (WeB Outside Of Browser) that allows you to
                | scrap data from bank
                | websites. What makes it wonderful is that bank connectors are
                | easy to build and maintained by their
                | community.

            p.image-text.
                I convinced the Cozy team to integrate weboob in the core
                stack. That's what they did it and I was able to make big progress 
                from there
